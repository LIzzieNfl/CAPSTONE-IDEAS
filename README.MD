Capstone Ideas
1. Blackbaud Assignment Dashboard
Problem Statement:
Teachers and students often struggle with tracking assignments and deadlines, especially when using systems that don’t provide an easy way to view and manage all assignments in one place. Blackbaud is widely used for educational management but lacks an intuitive, centralized view for students to track their coursework and due dates.

Project Objective:
Create a user-friendly dashboard that consolidates assignment data from the Blackbaud portal into a single interface. The goal is to streamline the tracking of coursework, due dates, and grades for students, helping them manage their time more effectively. This dashboard will integrate with Blackbaud's API (or a simulated API if needed) and will display assignments by subject, due date, and completion status.

Features:

Pull assignment data from Blackbaud.

Display assignments in a calendar view or list format.

Provide an overview of upcoming deadlines and assignments.

Include a notification system to alert students when assignments are due.

Allow students to filter assignments by subject or due date.

2. Class of 2033 Memory Website
Problem Statement:
Parents and teachers often wish to preserve memories of their child’s early school years, but there is no simple platform for sharing and revisiting these memories as the students progress through each grade.

Project Objective:
Create a memory-sharing website for the Class of 2033 that allows parents and teachers to upload photos, videos, and memories from kindergarten through to graduation in 8th grade. The website will allow users to contribute to an evolving timeline, creating an interactive journey that grows with the students over time. This platform will allow each student to have their own page, with photos and events recorded year by year.

Features:

User profiles for each student.

Upload options for photos, videos, and memory descriptions.

A timeline or interactive page for each student that grows year by year.

Memory sharing options (e.g., allowing parents and teachers to submit memories).

A "graduation" section when students finish 8th grade.

3. Simple Personal Budget Tracker (Idea)
Problem Statement:
Many individuals struggle to track their personal finances and budgeting. Existing tools often require extensive setup or are too complicated for users who just want a simple solution to keep track of their expenses.

Project Objective:
Create a simple personal budget tracker web application that allows users to input their income and expenses, categorize them, and visually track their budget. The application will provide basic financial summaries (e.g., total income, total expenses, balance, and categories of spending) to help users make informed decisions about their spending.

Features:

Add income and expenses, along with categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment, utilities).

View a summary of monthly income, expenses, and balance.

Display charts or graphs to visualize spending patterns.

Allow users to edit or delete entries.

Save data in the browser (using LocalStorage or a simple database).
